This app is to fix the broken flashlight and quicksettings flashlight tile in some custom roms. The app works on a very limited number of devices. Make sure to enable this apps' tile in the quicksettings instead of the stock tile. Root required.

You can turn on/off the flashlight from the app, widget, or quicksettings tile.
